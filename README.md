## About

This mini project was entirely developed by me in 2024.

The objective of this game is to guess the generated sequence of numbers within 10 chances. You will receive indications about how many digits you have guessed correctly and placed correctly, as well as how many digits you have guessed correctly but placed incorrectly.

 Additionally, you have the option to play solo or with friends. At the start, the program will prompt you to specify the length of the sequence and the maximum digit that can appear.

Furthermore, you can enjoy endless rounds of gameplay, as the program will inquire whether you wish to play another game at the end. Additionally, you have the flexibility to modify the number of players, the length of the sequence, and the maximum digit.
